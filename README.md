* Able to open post link with w3m or your default browser
* Configurable colors
* Also includes an external log for debugging

## Install

**Note: feednix use c++14 feature**

### Distribution Packages

[Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/feednix/)

### From Source
Thank you @chrisjohnston for mentioning the following dependencies for Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libjsoncpp-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libncursesw5-dev`

Thank you @bandb42 for mentioning the following dependencies for Fedora:

`sudo yum install dh-autoreconf ncursesw-devel jsoncpp-devel libcurl-devel`

**Note:** If you are using Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint or you are getting an error during build, please use the Ubuntu-stable branch instead of the main.

First run autogen.sh script.

Then run your standard make commands. Here is a one liner:

`./configure && make && sudo make install`


## Notes on Sign In Method and Rate Limiting (PLEASE READ)

Due to the fact that this is open source, the administrators at Feedly have
asked me to use their developer tokens instead of giving me a client secret.
To explain, if I were to use a client secret I would need to distribute it
along with the source code. This is an obvious security risk and I am going
to keep this project open source, hence this new method.

**Unfortunatley, as of now, the Developer tokens have an expiration of**
**three months. This means that you must create a new one every three months.**

**I have modified Feednix to help you with this. IT CANNOT DO THIS**
**AUTOMATICALLY since developer tokens involve sending you an email**
**to retrive them.**

In addition, becuase it is using the Dev Tokens, it is thus using the Sandbox.
This means that there is a rate limiting to the amount of requests that Feednix
can make. If you use Feednix rarely you will probably be fine. If you use it often,
however, you should consider disabling a few features to minimize the amount of
requests. This includes having this in your config file:

* markReadWhileScrolling : false
* enablePersistentCount : false
